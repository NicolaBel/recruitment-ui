# music-ui
This is my first Vue project so take it easy on me.\
This project was templated from Vue 3 in Vite.

There is absolutely no CSS or formatting done. This was on purpose to get the function working first.\
This is a starting point for this project. Obviously there is more that could be done to improve it.

### Questions
1. What is good and what needs to change?
2. Does the directory structure make sense?
3. Is the layout sound?
4. Are the components separate enough or are they too dependant on each other?

## Recommended IDE Setup
